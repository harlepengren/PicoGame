# Pico Game

PicoGame is a tiny game device designed to run simple games on the Raspberry Pi Pico.

# The Hardware
Requires a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) connected to a [2.2" TFT LCD Display](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1480) using the [ili9341 driver](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf).

# The Game Engine
There are two ways to use the game engine:
- C/C++: The engine can be called directly in C/C++ if the game is written in C/C++.
- Micropython Module: The game engine can be compiled into a micropython module allowing the games to be written in Python.

## Micropython Module
After cloning the repository, you need to get Micropython as a submodule.

    $ git submodule update --init

Get the micropython submodules:

    $ cd micropython
    $ git submodule update --init

Compile mpy-cross, which is required for the ports:

    $ cd mpy-cross
    $ make

Build the module in the ports/rp2 folder:

    $ cd ports/rp2
    $ make USER_C_MODULES=../../../module/pciogame.cmake

## Using the Engine
Connect the board to your computer using bootsel mode. Copy firmware.uf2 into the Raspberry Pico folder. This will cause the Raspberry Pico to reboot. I use [Thonny](https://thonny.org) for Micropython.

`import PicoGame`

Currently, there are two classes:
- PicoInput: handles input operations
- PicoScreen: handles screen drawing

For example, to clear the screen with a blue background:

```
import PicoGame
screen = PicoGame.PicoScreen()
screen.clear_screen(0x421d)
screen.render()
```

clear_screen takes one argument, which is the color to use to clear the screen. This is a 16 bit color. This is sometimes called 565, because it uses 5 bits for red and blue and 6 bits for green. I use [565 Color Picker](https://rgbcolorpicker.com/565) to get the hex value. However, if you prefer to convert a 24 bit color, you can use the following Python code with a tuple (r,g,b):

```
def convert_color(color):
    """Convert from RGB to RGB565 hex. The input argument color is a tuple (R, G, B)"""
    # note that because we are going from 24 bits to 16 bits, there will be significant color loss

    red = ((color[0] >> 3) & 0x1f) << 11
    green = ((color[2] >> 2) & 0x3f) << 5
    blue = ((color[1] >> 3) & 0x1f)

    return (red | green | blue)
```
